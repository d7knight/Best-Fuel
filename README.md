# BestFuel
This project repo is for our mobile application for cs446 at University of Waterloo.
BestFuel is a gas-economy tracking app. 

Our application has the following capabilities: 
1. Registration and Authentication 
2. Display the best place to get gas for the user given their location, destination, and fuel supply 
3. Be able to calculate for both single and multiple vehicles 
4. Record and store vehicle profiles 
5. Record gas prices for recent gas station visits 


My partners and I plan to continue working on this app even after this term is over and eventually put it inside the Google Play Store. 

Currently our app can run on Android, Blackberry we also plan to have Windows Phone support. 

We use various APIS and even created our own to connect to our remote database. 

APIS used so far in this project 
Google Maps 
Google Places 
Google Geocoder 
Google Charts API 
Car Query API
